# Graphics-Project

This repository holds my computer gaphics project.
It's a quasi Japanese scene of going through a thousand torii gate in a neon retro land scape with pyramids.
All models and the sky box are stored here.
The zip file has everything needed to run it.
I am adding the models that I have worked on here.
